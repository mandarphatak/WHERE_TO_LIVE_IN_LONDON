# WHERE_TO_LIVE_IN_LONDON
This is a capstone project for Google data analytics professional certificate
We moved to London right in the middle of the COVID-19 Omicron wave.
We lived in an Airbnb that was located reasonably close to where my wife works and searched for a longer-term accommodation. 
Friends provided us with a variety of opinions about how different places in London are: the posh ones, the cheap ones, and the ones that would be just right for us!
Accordingly, we sifted through a deluge of property listings all over London, were heavily disappointed in most house viewings, 
and finally settled on something that seemed alright and didnâ€™t break our pockets. 
Did we make the right decision? Is there a way to find out?
